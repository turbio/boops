# boops

A board showing any Github PR with the label `boop`.

## why?

At replit we've found tracking pull requests across many repositories on Github has a lot of overhead. It isn't always clear what to review. Checking many repositories is time consuming and Github's notifications are a bit of a mess.

The concept is very simple: any PR with the label boop will be listed on a shared board everyone can see. If you want your PR reviewd you add the boop label. This becomes pretty powerful when combined with the [unbooper](https://repl.it/@turbio/unbooper)
